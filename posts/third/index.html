His video was completely straightforward and thanks to him, I was able to successfully created my first-ever website using 000webhost.com. Initially, I was proud of the website i created and loved the idea of establishing an online identity for myself with it. However, as time passed, I began to dislike the design and decided to start anew by going onto my second website-building adventure.\nI learned about static site generators like Hugo and Jekyll, which utilize Markdown, and after comparing my options, I decided Hugo was a good fit for me. I chose the Contrast theme because it had a dark theme and I liked the arrangement of the posts. As someone who had never created a website from scratch before, I relied heavily on YouTube tutorials for step-by-step guidance. However, I faced a lot of challenges along the way and struggled with finding solutions to them. I faced errors that the YouTubers didn’t encounter, which left me frustrated. I had to consult the documentation and navigate certain areas on my own because the theme had either changed or differed from the one in the video. The process involved more trial and error than smooth progress, leading to multiple moments of doubt and frustration. Eventually, I successfully created my second website, and I felt proud of my accomplishment. However, after a few hours of reviewing the website, I realized I didn’t like it and decided to explore different Hugo themes.\n","wordCount":"348","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-06-22T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-06-22T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://mangotangosango.github.io/posts/third/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"khayali","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://mangotangosango.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://mangotangosango.github.io/ accesskey=h title="khayali (Alt + H)">khayali</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://mangotangosango.github.io/about title=About><span>About</span></a></li><li><a href=https://mangotangosango.github.io/posts title=Posts><span>Posts</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class=post-title>UNDECIDED</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-06-22 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>June 22, 2023</span></div></header><div class=post-content><p>In December 2022, I had the sudden urge to create my first ever blogging website where I could discuss topics I&rsquo;m passionate about.
