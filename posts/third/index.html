There were many options available to create a website, including WordPress and Medium. It was difficult at first to find the perfect one for me. I wanted a platform that was cost-efficient, flexible, and allow me to mold it into a design that truly reflected my style. I’ve considered using Wordpress, however, its high expenses and their limited capabilities as a free tier held me back.\nI came across my favorite Youtuber NetworkChuck’s youtube video on creating a website. His video was completely straightforward and thanks to him, I was able to successfully created my first-ever website using 000webhost.com. At first, I was proud of the website i created and loved the idea of establishing an online identity for myself with it. However, as time passed, I began to dislike the basic and limited design and decided to start from scratch again by going onto my second website-building adventure.\nI learned about static site generators like Hugo and Jekyll which were open-source framework used for building static websites with file-based content. The concept of using codes to create a website intrigued me, so I decided to give Hugo a try. I chose the Contrast theme as my first Hugo theme because it had a dark theme and appealing design. As a complete beginner in website development, I had to rely on YouTube tutorials for step-by-step guidance. When the tutorials were difficult for me to follow, I had to consult the documentation and Google alot. I’ve gone through a lot of failed attempts and error that led me lost and hopeless. Eventually, I successfully created my second website, and I felt proud of my accomplishment. But again, after a few hours of just looking at the website, I realized I didn’t like it and decided to explore different Hugo themes.\nI went through a lot of theme changes, hoping to find this one theme that I felt satified with. However, I never was satisfied and my limited web development skills didn’t help through my journey. I struggled with tasks like adjusting the shade color of the dark mode or changing from ProfileMode to HomeMode. Despite relying heavily on YouTube tutorials. Eventually, I made the decision to prioritize a peaceful life and avoid unnecessary struggles by seeking out a platform that was easier to work on. After all, my main goal was to create a blog and focus on blogging and not getting aught up with these complex web tasks.\nThat’s how I reconsidered WordPress again.\nIn January 2023, I made the decision to switch to WordPress.com as my blogging platform. Although it had a lot of limitations, especially in the free version, it fulfilled my main goal of writing blog posts. For a long time, WordPress was my bloggin platform.\nIn May 2023, I was frustrated with the number of ads appearing on my WordPress website. I never liked them so I contemplated on either pretending they did not exist or upgrading to a paid version. On top of that, I tried not to customize a lot in my wordpress since a lot of their features required premium upgrades. I was having second thoughts on returning back to using Hugo themes, especially the PaperMod theme, but was it worth struggles, misery and angst?\nIn mid-June 2023, I decided to give creating a website with Hugo and the PaperMod theme another try. I did have previous experience with Hugo themes and was better at terminal compared to before so the process have been much easier. The smooth process was a bit surprising to me; it reminded me how much I’ve gotten better with web development with Hugo compared to my first time. With a little guidance from the Hugo documentation, I was able to successfully create for myself a personal blog website that had more flexibility to style the website as I preferred it. I did, however, struggle a bunch with deploying my website to Github Pages.\nOverall, this journey has been a great learning experience for me and I’ve learned a lot in the process. Hopefully, this time, I stick to this current theme, whether it fit my style or not.\n","wordCount":"713","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-06-22T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-06-22T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://mangotangosango.github.io/posts/third/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"khayali's blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://mangotangosango.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://mangotangosango.github.io/ accesskey=h title="khayali's blog (Alt + H)">khayali's blog</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://mangotangosango.github.io/about title=About><span>About</span></a></li><li><a href=https://mangotangosango.github.io/posts title=Posts><span>Posts</span></a></li><li><a href=https://mangotangosango.github.io/projects title=Projects><span>Projects</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class=post-title>The Journey of a Blogger to Finding the Perfect Website</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-06-22 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>June 22, 2023</span></div></header><div class=post-content><p>In December 2022, I had the sudden urge to create my first ever blogging website where I could discuss topics I&rsquo;m passionate about.
