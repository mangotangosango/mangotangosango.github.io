[{"content":"In December 2022, I had the sudden urge to create my first ever blogging website where I could discuss topics I\u0026rsquo;m passionate about. There were many options available to create a website, including WordPress and Medium. It was difficult at first to find the perfect one for me. I wanted a platform that was cost-efficient, flexible, and allow me to mold it into a design that truly reflected my style. I\u0026rsquo;ve considered using Wordpress, however, its high expenses and their limited capabilities as a free tier held me back.\nI came across my favorite Youtuber NetworkChuck\u0026rsquo;s youtube video on creating a website. His video was completely straightforward and thanks to him, I was able to successfully created my first-ever website using 000webhost.com. At first, I was proud of the website i created and loved the idea of establishing an online identity for myself with it. However, as time passed, I began to dislike the basic and limited design and decided to start from scratch again by going onto my second website-building adventure.\nI learned about static site generators like Hugo and Jekyll which were open-source framework used for building static websites with file-based content. The concept of using codes to create a website intrigued me, so I decided to give Hugo a try. I chose the Contrast theme as my first Hugo theme because it had a dark theme and appealing design. As a complete beginner in website development, I had to rely on YouTube tutorials for step-by-step guidance. When the tutorials were difficult for me to follow, I had to consult the documentation and Google alot. I\u0026rsquo;ve gone through a lot of failed attempts and error that led me lost and hopeless. Eventually, I successfully created my second website, and I felt proud of my accomplishment. But again, after a few hours of just looking at the website, I realized I didn\u0026rsquo;t like it and decided to explore different Hugo themes.\nI went through a lot of theme changes, hoping to find this one theme that I felt satified with. However, I never was satisfied and my limited web development skills didn\u0026rsquo;t help through my journey. I struggled with tasks like adjusting the shade color of the dark mode or changing from ProfileMode to HomeMode. Despite relying heavily on YouTube tutorials. Eventually, I made the decision to prioritize a peaceful life and avoid unnecessary struggles by seeking out a platform that was easier to work on. After all, my main goal was to create a blog and focus on blogging and not getting aught up with these complex web tasks.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s how I reconsidered WordPress again.\nIn January 2023, I made the decision to switch to WordPress.com as my blogging platform. Although it had a lot of limitations, especially in the free version, it fulfilled my main goal of writing blog posts. For a long time, WordPress was my bloggin platform.\nIn May 2023, I was frustrated with the number of ads appearing on my WordPress website. I never liked them so I contemplated on either pretending they did not exist or upgrading to a paid version. On top of that, I tried not to customize a lot in my wordpress since a lot of their features required premium upgrades. I was having second thoughts on returning back to using Hugo themes, especially the PaperMod theme, but was it worth struggles, misery and angst?\nIn mid-June 2023, I decided to give creating a website with Hugo and the PaperMod theme another try. I did have previous experience with Hugo themes and was better at terminal compared to before so the process have been much easier. The smooth process was a bit surprising to me; it reminded me how much I\u0026rsquo;ve gotten better with web development with Hugo compared to my first time. With a little guidance from the Hugo documentation, I was able to successfully create for myself a personal blog website that had more flexibility to style the website as I preferred it. I did, however, struggle a bunch with deploying my website to Github Pages.\nOverall, this journey has been a great learning experience for me and I\u0026rsquo;ve learned a lot in the process. Hopefully, this time, I stick to this current theme, whether it fit my style or not.\n","permalink":"https://mangotangosango.github.io/posts/third/","summary":"In December 2022, I had the sudden urge to create my first ever blogging website where I could discuss topics I\u0026rsquo;m passionate about.

Unfortunately, with the rise of AI and NLP, phishing attacks are becoming more convincing and creative. AI’s natural language processing help generate for you any sort of content you desire, including writing emails, which is a perfect tool for phishing attack.\nThe availability of AI, such as ChatGPT, has made it quite easier for attackers to generate convincing emails. This time, phishing emails are so convincing that they almost look legitimate. We used to easily detect phishing scams through their grammatical and spelling mistakes, however, AI-generated emails are completely free of grammatical mistakes, making it difficult for some to recognize the phishing attempts and protect themselves.\nAdditionally, it is much quicker to generate emails using AI than it is to type them out by hand. This gives a chance for attackers to create much more phishing emails than they would by typing. Even Marcus Hutchins showed the ease of creating perfect phishing emails using ChatGPT in just a minute.\nGiven the fact that people are already susceptible to falling for human-generated phishing emails and experiencing unfortunate losses, with the increasing prevalence and deception of AI-generated emails , one can only speculate on the potential impact of this issue and the risks it may pose.\nHowever, despite the challenges by AI, there has been significant progress made in detecting and combating these emails. While attackers use NLP to create emails, NLP can also be used to analyze the contents of an email to identify phishing keywords, unusual language patterns, or social engineering techniques commonly employed in phishing attempts. AI can also analyze phishing patterns, examine images and visual elements, among other capabilities.\nOn top of that, there have been trainings that provide security awareness to users to help recognize the red flags of phishing techniques and how to spot them. For instance, users are advised to be alert to “urgent” or unexpected emails, regardless of whether they recognize the sender or not. Staying updated with the latest phishing techniques enables users to not only protect themselves but also educate and protect their loved ones.\n","permalink":"https://mangotangosango.github.io/posts/second/","summary":"We’ve all heard about the impact that phishing attacks have had, causing detrimental effects on people’s reputation and financial well-being.

I had a slight difficulty with Bandit Level 11 so I’ve decided to write it out here.\nIn this level we are told that the password is stored in the file data.txt, where all lowercase (a-z) and uppercase (A-Z) letters have been rotated by 13 positions. When we run cat data.txt, this is what we get:\nGur cnffjbeq vf WIAOOSFzMjXXBC0KoSKBbJ8puQm5lIEi\nAs we are told, all of the lowercase and uppercase letters are rotated by 13 positions, or in other words ROT13. Below is a visual explanation of ROT13.\nSo, in order to get the password, we need to decode the encoded letters back by 13 positions.\nAlright how can we do that? If we go back to the website, we are given some commands as hints. We used the base64 command in level 10 so we cancel that and what’s before it. And with a simple whatis tr command, we can assume that the tr command will be used.\nIn the end, the command tr \u0026quot;A-Za-z\u0026quot; \u0026quot;N-ZA-Mn-za-m\u0026quot; will be used to retreive our command.\nTo break down the command in simple terms, we will be using the command to: Bring out the alphabets from A-Z and a-z, and swap it with N-Z(note that letter N is the 14th letter and M is the 13th letter) and A-M and likewise with the lower case letters.\nHere is a visual explanation of A-Z swapping with N-M.
