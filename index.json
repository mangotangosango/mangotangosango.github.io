[{"content":"In December 2022, I had the sudden urge to create my first ever blogging website where I could discuss topics I\u0026rsquo;m passionate about. However, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure which blogging platform to use as there were many options available to create a website, including WordPress and Medium. I wanted a platform that was cost-efficient, flexible, and allow me to mold it into a design that truly reflected my style. Unfortunately, everywhere I turned, people discouraged me from using WordPress, due to high expenses and limited capabilities, so I cancelled Wordpress from my options from the beginning.\nI came across my favorite Youtuber NetworkChuck\u0026rsquo;s youtube video on creating a website. His video was completely straightforward and thanks to him, I was able to successfully created my first-ever website using 000webhost.com. Initially, I was proud of the website i created and loved the idea of establishing an online identity for myself with it. However, as time passed, I began to dislike the design and decided to start anew by going onto my second website-building adventure.\nI learned about static site generators like Hugo and Jekyll, which utilize Markdown, and after comparing my options, I decided Hugo was a good fit for me. I chose the Contrast theme because it had a dark theme and I liked the arrangement of the posts. As someone who had never created a website from scratch before, I relied heavily on YouTube tutorials for step-by-step guidance. However, I faced a lot of challenges along the way and struggled with finding solutions to them. I faced errors that the YouTubers didn\u0026rsquo;t encounter, which left me frustrated. I had to consult the documentation and navigate certain areas on my own because the theme had either changed or differed from the one in the video. The process involved more trial and error than smooth progress, leading to multiple moments of doubt and frustration. Eventually, I successfully created my second website, and I felt proud of my accomplishment. However, after a few hours of reviewing the website, I realized I didn\u0026rsquo;t like it and decided to explore different Hugo themes.\n","permalink":"https://mangotangosango.github.io/posts/third/","summary":"In December 2022, I had the sudden urge to create my first ever blogging website where I could discuss topics I\u0026rsquo;m passionate about.

Unfortunately, with the rise of AI and NLP, phishing attacks are becoming more convincing and creative. AI’s natural language processing help generate for you any sort of content you desire, including writing emails, which is a perfect tool for phishing attack.\nThe availability of AI, such as ChatGPT, has made it quite easier for attackers to generate convincing emails. This time, phishing emails are so convincing that they almost look legitimate. We used to easily detect phishing scams through their grammatical and spelling mistakes, however, AI-generated emails are completely free of grammatical mistakes, making it difficult for some to recognize the phishing attempts and protect themselves.\nAdditionally, it is much quicker to generate emails using AI than it is to type them out by hand. This gives a chance for attackers to create much more phishing emails than they would by typing. Even Marcus Hutchins showed the ease of creating perfect phishing emails using ChatGPT in just a minute.\nGiven the fact that people are already susceptible to falling for human-generated phishing emails and experiencing unfortunate losses, with the increasing prevalence and deception of AI-generated emails , one can only speculate on the potential impact of this issue and the risks it may pose.\nHowever, despite the challenges by AI, there has been significant progress made in detecting and combating these emails. While attackers use NLP to create emails, NLP can also be used to analyze the contents of an email to identify phishing keywords, unusual language patterns, or social engineering techniques commonly employed in phishing attempts. AI can also analyze phishing patterns, examine images and visual elements, among other capabilities.\nOn top of that, there have been trainings that provide security awareness to users to help recognize the red flags of phishing techniques and how to spot them. For instance, users are advised to be alert to “urgent” or unexpected emails, regardless of whether they recognize the sender or not. Staying updated with the latest phishing techniques enables users to not only protect themselves but also educate and protect their loved ones.\n","permalink":"https://mangotangosango.github.io/posts/second/","summary":"We’ve all heard about the impact that phishing attacks have had, causing detrimental effects on people’s reputation and financial well-being.

OverTheWire.org is a series of challenges that helps you develop security concepts in for of games. I had a slight difficulty with Bandit Level 11 so I’ve decided to write it out here.\nIn this level we are told that the password is stored in the file data.txt, where all lowercase (a-z) and uppercase (A-Z) letters have been rotated by 13 positions. When we run cat data.txt, this is what we get:\nGur cnffjbeq vf WIAOOSFzMjXXBC0KoSKBbJ8puQm5lIEi\nAs we are told, all of the lowercase and uppercase letters are rotated by 13 positions, or in other words ROT13. Below is a visual explanation of ROT13.\nSo, in order to get the password, we need to decode the encoded letters back by 13 positions.\nAlright how can we do that? If we go back to the website, we are given some commands as hints. We used the base64 command in level 10 so we cancel that and what’s before it. And with a simple whatis tr command, we can assume that the tr command will be used.\nIn the end, the command tr \u0026quot;A-Za-z\u0026quot; \u0026quot;N-ZA-Mn-za-m\u0026quot; will be used to retreive our command.\nTo break down the command in simple terms, we will be using the command to: Bring out the alphabets from A-Z and a-z, and swap it with N-Z(note that letter N is the 14th letter and M is the 13th letter) and A-M and likewise with the lower case letters.\nHere is a visual explanation of A-Z swapping with N-M. Result after we enter tr \u0026quot;A-Za-z\u0026quot; \u0026quot;N-ZA-Mn-za-m\u0026quot; : The password is JVNBBFSmZwKKOP0XbFXOoW8chDz5yVRv\n","permalink":"https://mangotangosango.github.io/posts/first/","summary":"Hello!
